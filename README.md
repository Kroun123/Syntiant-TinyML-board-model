# Syntiant-TinyML-board-model

I share 3D model of the Syntiant TinyML board.
Be aware, that model dimensions are based on the manual measurement with the caliper, so it is not so precise as it was generated directly from PCB CAD software.
I believe that it is still useful for designing own model of housing.
