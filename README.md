# Syntiant-TinyML-board-model

I'm sharing a 3D model of the Syntiant TinyML board. Please note that the dimensions of the model are based on manual measurements using a caliper, so they are not as accurate as if they were generated directly from the PCB CAD software. I believe it is still useful for designing your own housing model.
